      "my great-great-great-grandmother, was born into slavery in 1846 in Hanover, a county where more than\n",
      "half of the population was enslaved. She died almost a century later, in 1944. Morris and others\n",

      "a photo of a man wearing blackface standing next to a person wearing Ku Klux Klan garb. After\n",
      "initially apologizing for the picture, Northam denied that they were of him, and an investigation\n",
      "into the matter was inconclusive. In response to claims of environmental racism in Virginia, the\n",
      "governor established an environmental justice council in January 2019 that makes recommendations,\n",

      "D.C. In a statement announcing the Wegmans project, Northam hailed it as a “significant win” that\n",
      "would bring hundreds of jobs to the county. Northam also approved a $2.35 million grant to pay for\n",
      "utility extensions, broadband installation, roadwork and other related project development costs.\n",
      "Although Wegmans owns more than 100 supermarkets up and down the East Coast, this project would only\n",
      "be the company’s third distribution center. “We were surprised when we first heard that there was\n",
      "people opposed to this,” says David DeMascole, director of supply chain planning for Wegmans. But\n",
      "upon hearing the concerns, “We said, Okay, well, let’s understand what those concerns are, and what\n",
      "can we do to mitigate them or work with them.” Wegmans is a private, family-owned company, he notes.\n",
      "“The Wegmans family is not answering to shareholders or Wall Street. They decide how they want the\n",
      "company run, and then that’s what we do.” “We compete with big companies, right, like Walmart and\n",
      "Kroger and all of them, and compared to them, we’re small,” DeMascole says. “We’re going to do the\n",
      "right thing. It’s hard for other people outside to see that and believe it, but we’ll be good\n",
      "neighbors because that’s just what we do.” The new distribution center, he explains, would be the\n",
      "“single biggest investment we’ve ever made in the history of our company,” and that’s why they are\n",
      "being “meticulous.” “We want to be good neighbors,” he emphasizes. “We’re not just saying that.” In\n",
      "response to community feedback, DeMascole says, Wegmans has made changes to the planned facility. It\n",
      "moved an employee entrance from opposite the Brown Grove Baptist Church to a few hundred feet down\n",
      "the road to alleviate traffic and prevent potential accidents, and it changed a truck route to keep\n",
      "vehicles away from a sharp turn on a road bordering an adjacent community; residents feared the road\n",
      "could become dangerous with increased traffic. The company also moved a planned parking lot for\n",
      "trucks away from bordering neighborhoods and will incorporate trees and shrubbery as a buffer\n",
      "between the facility and those houses. Passersby are “not even going to be able to see our\n",
      "warehouse,” DeMascole says, adding: “We think we’ve done things already to the site that weren’t\n",
      "required, and we’ll continue to look for opportunities where we can make a difference.” But some\n",
      "residents of Brown Grove, several of whom will share a property line with the project, say Wegmans\n",
      "hasn’t done enough to consult the community directly. County and state officials announced the\n",
      "project at a meeting in February 2020 at a local school. The next day, the real estate agent\n",
      "representing Wegmans reached out to Brown Grove Baptist Church for a meeting with a handful of\n",
      "church leaders — providing, Bonnica says, only an hour and a half notice. (A representative for\n",
      "Wegmans confirmed the company’s participation in these and other meetings with neighbors, but “none\n",
      "of the meetings were called by or arranged by Wegmans,” she wrote in an email, “so we can’t speak to\n",
      "when notification of these meetings occurred.”) Wegmans never reached out to Brown Grove residents\n",
      "directly to hear what concerns the community might have, the activists say, and few of the questions\n",
      "they raised have been addressed. Residents also question the benefits Wegmans would bring to the\n",
      "community. Wegmans won’t offer any specific contributions to Brown Grove, DeMascole says, beyond tax\n",
      "revenue to the county, jobs available to anyone in the region and a walking trail planned for the\n",
      "edge of the property. When asked if jobs were being set aside specifically for residents of nearby\n",
      "communities like Brown Grove, DeMascole says, “We haven’t set goals” on that, but “the expectation\n",
      "and strategy is that they will mostly be local.” There are also no plans to improve the community by\n",
      "creating sidewalks or playgrounds. Renada is skeptical that the Wegmans project would be any\n",
      "different from when other companies have come along over these many years, which she says has only\n",
      "brought pollution and nuisance and no apparent benefits to the community. “The governor said that\n",
      "Wegmans is going to be good neighbors,” she argues, “but none of the other businesses that have been\n",
      "here for years have been good neighbors.” When it comes to industrial growth in Brown Grove, she\n",
      "says, “We don’t see the direct impact. We just see the businesses that come here and take.” Now, as\n",

      "distribution center began at that February 2020 meeting. The county, the state and Wegmans made it\n",
      "sound as if the project was a “done deal,” he said later. But he had questions. He wondered why the\n",
      "county had asked Wegmans to apply to Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality for a wetlands\n",
      "permit — as opposed to an industrial storm-water permit that would require Wegmans to examine\n",
      "downstream effects like potential pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. (Wegmans representatives said\n",
      "they have “satisfied” all permit requirements for county and federal agencies. DEQ declined to\n",
      "comment on a case currently under litigation.) There were also errors in how the company calculated\n",
      "the wetlands that would be affected, French contends, with Wegmans initially claiming the project\n",
      "would disturb only six acres of wetlands and then revising to approximately 15 after a public\n",
      "outcry. French believes, based on his own analysis, that the project may affect up to 32 acres of\n",
      "critical wetlands. “These holes are so gaping, you can drive a Wegmans distribution center truck\n",
      "right through it,” he says. “Out of 22 years of experience, I have never seen anything like this\n",
      "before, where rules have been blatantly disregarded.” In fact, French worked at the Virginia\n",
      "Department of Environmental Quality for more than four years as a water-quality planner. Now he’s\n",
      "facing off against the regulatory agency and his former co-workers — including the manager assigned\n",
      "to the Wegmans project who took him out to lunch his first day on the job, he says. “That’s not\n",
      "fun,” French says of being on the opposite side of old colleagues. But he believes he has an ethical\n",
      "obligation to make sure, when the stakes are this high, that everyone involved is following the\n",
      "rules. “I’m doing what’s right,” he says. DeMascole says the site has been planned around the\n",
      "wetlands in order to minimize its effects. “We don’t need to use the whole property,” he says. When\n",
      "it came to the site design, “We moved it and tried to shape it to work around the contour of the\n",
      "land.” The property could have held a 2.1 million-square-foot facility, he points out, but the\n",
      "center is a little more than half that size — although there is room to expand it in the future, he\n",
      "acknowledges. Beyond its environmental value, the wetlands are also the final resting place of Brown\n",
      "Grove’s ancestors. I grew up hearing about the graves, and elders in the community, like Charles\n",
      "Morris, who is in his 70s, say they still remember where they are. It is illegal under Virginia law\n",
      "to disturb any cemetery, and Wegmans must preserve any human remains or historical artifacts found\n",
      "while excavating the area. The company hired experts to comb the official records and walk the\n",
      "property, looking for signs of burial grounds, DeMascole says. There is an active cemetery — the one\n",
      "where my grandmother and other family members are buried — near one side of the property. This\n",
      "cemetery is not on the proposed distribution center site, but unknown graves may exist beyond the\n",
      "boundaries of the graveyard. And Morris says there are older, unmarked graves on another side of the\n",
      "proposed site — across from the church, where the bulk of the facility would be built — that have\n",
      "not yet been found. “We’ve hired consultants, archaeologists that have searched the site and\n",
      "searched all of the records, and they’ve found no documentation to say that there are graves there,”\n",
      "DeMascole says. “They have not found anything.” If additional graves are discovered, he says,\n",
      "Wegmans will follow all state procedures and protocols for the “remains to be dealt with in the\n",
      "appropriate manner.” Brown Grove residents aren’t surprised that no documentation of centuries-old\n",
      "unmarked graves could be found in the official records. Its history, like that of many other African\n",
      "American communities, has been passed down in tradition and stories. Just because the graves cannot\n",
      "be located via county records or other research does not mean they don’t exist, residents say, or\n",
      "that the search for them should be over. They also wonder why the archaeology consultant did a walk-\n",
      "through of the property to search for graves instead of using ground-penetrating radar, which can be\n",
      "effective at locating old, unmarked graves. Wegmans representatives said that method wouldn’t work\n",
      "well in an environment with tree roots and other disturbances to the ground. More pressingly, Brown\n",
      "Grove residents wonder why Wegmans would be comfortable disturbing potential graves at all. But\n",
      "Wegmans argues that it makes a big difference that the graves haven’t been located yet. “This land\n",
      "is commercially available, zoned industrial,” DeMascole says. “The fact that if these remains are\n",
      "there, and they have not been found or identified — should that mean that the land should just\n",
      "remain vacant forever?” He adds, “There’s other people that own this property, and they feel they\n",
      "have a right to sell the property. From our perspective, we found land that was zoned properly and\n",
      "said: This is in the perfect location, and we’re going to be good neighbors, and it’s all going to\n",
      "work out.”  After the February 2020 meeting, French and Bonnica joined a group called Protect\n",
      "Hanover, made up of residents from nearby subdivisions, that formed in opposition to the Wegmans\n",
      "project. The two hadn’t met before, but they quickly began poring over Freedom of Information Act\n",
      "requests and scheduling meetings with local and state politicians, activist groups and others who\n",
      "could help with the cause. Bonnica soon brought in her sisters, Renada and Kimberlyn, and neighbors\n",
      "to help with the onslaught of work. The newly fledged activists found themselves spending hours each\n",
      "week reading historical, legal and scientific documents, holding meetings and planning community\n",
      "events. Even after a year of working to block the Wegmans site, Bonnica says, “It’s the center of\n",
      "our world right now.” In February 2021, Virginia’s water control board met virtually to review\n",
      "Wegmans’s application and vote on whether the company could build on wetlands. At work, Renada held\n",
      "her comb in one hand and her phone, to text with other organizers, in the other, watching the online\n",
      "meeting on a laptop propped on her salon workstation. It was a Friday, the busiest day at the salon,\n",
      "and she couldn’t take off for the all-day meeting. Renada told her client, who had an hours-long\n",
      "appointment, that she would be unusually quiet so she could focus on the meeting and then say her\n",
      "piece during the virtual public comment period. She had barely slept the night before, her nerves\n",
      "were coiled so tightly. Renada spoke to the board around 4 p.m., and the meeting went into the\n",
      "evening. Around 7, one of the board members announced they would cut short the public comments in\n",
      "order to hold a vote to approve or deny the permit for building on wetlands. The board voted: four\n",
      "in favor, three against. The permit passed, but with a much narrower margin than any of the\n",
      "activists had expected. French, for one, was optimistic. “We got three people on our side,” he says.\n",
      "“If this decision was to be challenged, if it was to go legal somehow, a judge is going to pay\n",
      "attention to the fact that it’s that close.” A month and a half later, exactly such a legal\n",
      "challenge was announced. Patricia Hunter-Jordan, president of the local NAACP chapter, stood on a\n",
      "podium in front of the stained-glass windows of Brown Grove Baptist Church and announced that the\n",
      "Hanover County NAACP, Protect Hanover and residents of nearby communities would file a lawsuit\n",
      "against the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Wegmans and Air Park Associates, the\n",
      "current property owners. The lawsuit alleged that the parties did not meet environmental justice\n",
      "requirements for engaging the community or considering alternative sites, and submitted erroneous\n",
      "information on the wetlands. “Let’s get into some good trouble,” Hunter-Jordan said, quoting the\n",
      "late Rep. John Lewis, over the noise of passing trucks. A separate lawsuit was filed by several\n",
      "residents who live close to the property against the Hanover County Board of Supervisors. The suit\n",
      "alleged that the board improperly amended land-use commitments previously made by the property owner\n",
      "to allow the project to move forward. Though the complaint was dismissed in November 2020 for lack\n",
      "of standing and it was later amended, a Hanover Circuit Court judge wrote an opinion that the case\n",
      "had no standing and would not move forward. Brown Grove protesters are hoping that another\n",
      "environmental justice case in Virginia provides a precedent for their own fight: In January 2020,\n",
      "the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled that Union Hill, a historically Black community\n",

      "checked.”  In June, there were breakthroughs and new complications for both sides. The U.S. Army\n",
      "Corps of Engineers issued a federal permit, a key step for Wegmans to proceed with the project.\n",
      "After all permits are completed and the property is purchased, DeMascole says, Wegmans hopes to\n",
      "begin construction as soon as the end of the summer. The news came as a shock to Renada, Bonnica and\n",
      "French. “You’ve got two lawsuits that are currently happening,” says French. “You’ve got now\n",
      "potentially a third that might occur” — a likely challenge to the federal permit in addition to\n",
      "those appealing the state’s decisions. Wegmans also now needs an air-quality permit after including\n",

      "week after the federal permit was issued, Brown Grove took an important step toward recognition as a\n",
