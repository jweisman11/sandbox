      "When Ferry was 13, his father gave him an articulated, or fully assembled, mouse skeleton that piqued his interest in osteology. As he learned more about the medical bone trade, he identified what he considers a fundamental problem: People have bones they don‚Äôt know what to do with. Until just a few decades ago, it was common for medical students to keep a half or full skeleton in their closet for school.\n",

      "The bones were often sourced from China and India, with the latter believed to have exported 60,000 skeletons and skulls to America in a single year, according to reporting in the Chicago Tribune when India outlawed the exportation of human remains in 1985. Experts say most of the remains were stolen from graves and then shipped overseas.\n",

      "This collection is not even the tip of the human remains iceberg, according to Damien Huffer, an adjunct research professor at Carleton University in Canada. Collectors across the world have much larger collections than JonsBones, he said, and the trade far predates TikTok.\n",

      "said Huffer, who is also a research associate in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Queensland in Australia.\n",
      "Human remains stretch far beyond the sanitized bones that belonged to the medical community. Organs are an even more specialized trade, Huffer said, and some collectors have brains and fetuses sealed in jars.\n",

      "As JonsBones gained fame on TikTok for videos showing his collection, viewers started to draw comparisons to a Tumblr account from 2015 of a purported witch who allegedly sold human bones and was accused of being a grave robber. The saga was deemed ‚ÄúBoneghazi.‚Äù\n",
      "Ferry has repeatedly rejected the comparison and assured viewers that his bones are only bought from people who have medical specimens they no longer want or have use for.\n",
      "He said medical bones can be distinguished from others by the telltale signs of medical preparation, and he tries to get as much information as possible about the bones‚Äô origins when he makes a purchase. That information is typically kept private unless a future buyer requests it, he said, and little can be discerned about the past of many of the pieces.\n",
      "‚ÄúA lot of these skulls are inherited or they come from yard sales and estate sales,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe majority of skulls in the market are inherited from previous owners, so tracking down authentic origins is extremely challenging.‚Äù\n",
      "He said despite the blowback he‚Äôs received from publicizing his business, he‚Äôs just happy people are talking about the medical bone trade.\n",
      "‚ÄúI really believe in trying to educate the next generation of anthropologists, doctors and educators,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that destroying these pieces are a solution.‚Äù\n",
      "Graham said the idea that these bones will go toward educational purposes doesn‚Äôt make sense, because without the context that could have been provided by ethically sourced bones whose origins were known, there is little educational value.\n",
      "People who donate their bodies to science are assured of the respectful way they will be disposed of after bodies have served its educational purpose, he said. It‚Äôs a consent-based process.\n",
      "Graham, of Carleton, said every human bone that changes hands through this industry is a piece of an ancestor who ‚Äúis not where they‚Äôre supposed to be.‚Äù\n",
      "‚ÄúNobody can object to buying and selling antiques or specimens, but these were humans,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd certainly not a single one of these people ever consented to their bodies being treated this way or being bought and sold like this.‚Äù\n",
      "And he said while the human bone trade can be disguised as education or art, Graham thinks there‚Äôs a different draw.\n",
